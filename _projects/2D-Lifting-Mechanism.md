In this project, I designed a 2D lifting mechanism using a rigid bar, three pin supports (two mounted on the ground), and a linear actuator selected from the Tolomatic catalog. The goal was to maximize the lifted weight and height within the given 150cm × 50cm design space.

### Key Design Choices
- **Rigid Bar Length:** 0.5 m  
- **Actuator Used:** Tolomatic IMA with peak force of 11,100 N  
- **Stroke Required:** ~348 mm  
- **Maximum Lifted Weight:** ~905 kg  
- **Pivot Position:** (0.10 m, 0.05 m)  
- **Payload Height Achieved:** From ~5° to ~64° bar rotation  

### Results
The chosen actuator and bar configuration allow lifting nearly **905 kg** while maintaining rigidity and fitting within the design constraints. The payload is raised significantly higher compared to its initial position, demonstrating efficient use of the actuator stroke.
